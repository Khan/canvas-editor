# /build/tmpl

These files are generated by the `gulp templates` command.

They are generated from files in the [tmpl](../../tmpl/) folder.
Each `.js` file is built from the matching `.handlebars` file.

There is a filter under the `templates` key in [build-paths.json][build-paths]
that matches `*.handlebars`.

[build-paths]: ../../build-paths.json
